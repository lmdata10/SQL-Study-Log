â€”- Solution:

with cte as
    (select *, row_number() over(partition by username order by startdate) as rnk
    , count(1) over(partition by username order by startdate
                    range between unbounded preceding and unbounded following) as cnt
    from UserActivity)
select username, activity, startdate, enddate
from cte
where rnk = case when cnt = 1 then 1 else cnt - 1 end;
