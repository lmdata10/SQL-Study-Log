2) Build a report, which displays the constructor championship table for each season. Have options such that user can choose the season and the no of results (top 10, top 5 etc.)
3) Display the following for 2022 season:
	year, race_no, circuit name, driver name, driver race position, driver race points, flag to indicate if winner
	, constructor name, constructor position, constructor points, , flag to indicate if constructor is winner
	, race status of each driver, flag to indicate fastest lap for which driver, total no of pit stops by each driver
